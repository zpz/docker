# minimalproj

This is an example minimal project. This file is at the top level
of the repo, i.e., this directory is the root directory of a repo
called "minimalproj".

What you need to customize:

- Replace "minimalproj" with the name of your actual repo.
- Rename the directory `src/minimalproj` to the name of your package.
