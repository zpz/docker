# project-template

This is an example minimal project. This file is at the top level
of the repo, i.e., this directory is the root directory of a repo
called "project-template".

What you need to customize:

- Replace "project-template" with the name of your actual repo.
- Rename the directory `project_template` in `/src` to the name of your package, with dash in the name replaced by underscore. This is the name of the Python package defined by this repo.
